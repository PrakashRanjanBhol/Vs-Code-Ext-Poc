Give it a while, because the search feature is like google: It shows the most popular links with the same name first. It is the same thing with apps: The most popular with a given name rank first. FOr new apps, even when searching that name, similar names will rank higher because your app is newer.\n\nWriting\n\npub:[Your Dev Name Here]\n\n\n(without the brackets)\n\nwill show only the apps published by you. No space between : and the first letter in the developer name.\n\nTL:DR;\n\nThe more downloads your app gets, the higher it will rank in searches. Changing the app name is not a good idea, as you will then take another long while to rank in the search for the new app name. Maintain the current name, make it good so it drives installs and it will rank higher eventually\n\nNOTE\n\nIt takes hour before the app shows in the search results. Meaning as you posted your app one hour ago, it will not rank for another day or so(in my experience). Getting it on top when there are many apps with similar names is even harder. But what you are experiencing is the time between your app being published and it showing in the search results.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            Share\n        \n\n\n                    \n                        Improve this answer\n                    \n\n                \n                    \n                        Follow\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n            \n\n\n            \n                \n    \n        \n            answered Apr 21, 2017 at 15:17\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Zoe♦Zoe\n        \n            27.9k2222 gold badges127127 silver badges155155 bronze badges\n        \n    \n\n\n\n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            0 \n    \n        \n            \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                 | \n            \n                 \n    \n    \n",

(There's a limit to \"as many as possible\" because there's only so much space available in the region the operating system uses to store environment variables and command-line arguments, so if find has many results, multiple mv invocations can be needed even with -exec ... {} +).\n\n\n\nCompare to this traditional command:\n\nfind */target -name 'myapp*.jar' -exec mv -t \"$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS\" {} ';'\n\n\nThis runs mv once per file found. Since /bin/mv is an external executable, this is implicitly expensive.\n\nBy contrast, \n\nfind */target -name 'myapp*.jar' -exec mv -t \"$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS\" {} +\n\n\n...runs as few mv invocations as possible. (Note that this usage requires the -t extension, which is not specified by POSIX; thus, it's only available on GNU platforms).\n\n\n\nFinally, || true is simply a boolean OR operation: If the find fails, then true runs, forcing the command to always result in a truthful result. If you're running with set -e, this prevents the script from being exited in the event of a failure.\n\nThis can also be more tersely written as ||:, as : is a synonym for true.\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            Share\n        \n\n\n                    \n                        Improve this answer\n                    \n\n                \n                    \n                        Follow\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n            \n            \n\n    \n        \n            edited May 11, 2016 at 20:39\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\n\n            \n                \n    \n        \n            answered May 11, 2016 at 20:18\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Charles DuffyCharles Duffy\n        \n            290k4343 gold badges418418 silver badges465465 bronze badges\n        \n    \n\n\n\n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n             \n    \n        \n            \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                 | \n            \n                 \n    \n    \n",

If nothing matches the conditions, it simply returns an empty relation.\nfind (and its related dynamic find_by_columnname methods) returns a single model object. If nothing is found, an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception is raised (but not with the dynamic find_by_ methods).\n\nWhile find can return an Array of records—not a Relation—if given a list of IDs, using where is preferred since Rails 3. Many similar uses of find are now deprecated or gone entirely.\n\n\nSo yes, if you only want and expect a single object, using find is easier, as otherwise you must call Model.where.first.\n\nNote that old-style hash options to find and many dynamic find_ methods are deprecated as of Rails 4.0 (see relevant release notes).\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            Share\n        \n\n\n                    \n                        Improve this answer\n                    \n\n                \n                    \n                        Follow\n                        \n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n            \n            \n\n    \n        \n            edited Aug 19, 2015 at 22:11\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\n\n            \n                \n    \n        \n            answered Mar 5, 2012 at 21:58\n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Andrew MarshallAndrew Marshall\n        \n            96.3k2020 gold badges223223 silver badges217217 bronze badges\n        \n    \n\n\n\n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            4 \n    \n        \n            \n\n                        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                i think that find can return several objects in an array - try User.find [1,2,3] (finds users with ids 1, 2 and 3)... but yeah i guess andrew is right about the rest\n                \n                \n– klump\n                \n                Mar 5, 2012 at 22:50\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    3\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @klump Yup, it can, but User.where(id: [1, 2, 3]) is preferred in that case so I didn't even consider it.
